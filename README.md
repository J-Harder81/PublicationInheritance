This project is based on the “Inheritance in C# and .NET” tutorial found at
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/tutorials/inheritance.
The tutorial provides implementations for classes Publication and Book. The project extends the
class hierarchy by creating a Periodical class, which in turn is a base class of Magazine, Journal
and Newspaper.
